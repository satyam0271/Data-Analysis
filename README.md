# Data Analysis Practice Projects ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my repository of data analysis projects! As a beginner in the field, 
I created this space to document my learning journey and showcase my practice work.

## About

In this repository, you'll find various projects that focus on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Basic statistical analysis

Each project uses simple datasets and includes explanations of the methods and techniques I applied. 
My goal is to build a strong foundation in data analysis and gain hands-on experience.


## Getting Started

To explore the projects, simply clone this repository and dive into the individual folders.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satyam0271/Data-Analysis.git
